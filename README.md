## Description
_This is a project I created at Epicodus that allows a user to determine their life expectancy (earth years) based on specific attributes.  It also allows the user to calculate their life expectancy based on the planet of their choosing (Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Venus).  Lastly this application calculates if the user has surpassed the average life expectancy on a their planet and returns the years lived past life expectancy.  This project represents my ability to navigate HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript/jQuery, strict TDD, and Github._

## Known Bugs

* In the __tests__ "describe", "test", and "expect" can read as not defined.  This doesn't affect the applications functionality (all npm commands in setup function correctly).  This doesn't occur everytime I open the application, but please be aware this may occur on some machines/instances.
